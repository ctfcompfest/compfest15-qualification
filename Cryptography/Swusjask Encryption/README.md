## Description
RSA is widely known and used as cryptography encryption algorithm and work under group Zp under multiplication. What if Iâ€™m trying my own cryptography encryption algorithm that work under some my defined group with my defined multiplication operation. I think this cryptography algorithm have secure enough to encrypt my data

## Difficulty
medium

## Hints
* Like RSA, the key behind decryption is to find order of group. Can you find it?
