## Description
That night was definitely the happiest of my life. I get to spend a night with my favorite girl, walking and strolling around the streets of Seoul, holding hands and enjoying the winter air with the beautiful night lights decorating our surroundings. Look, I even took a picture of her! Although, she was really camera-shy. What I don’t really get is, my friends told me that all of this is just in my imaginations. I can assure you I did have a date with her. Otherwise, how would I take this picture?!

Anyway, I organize my dating pictures by location. The problem is, I forgot the name of the street where I took this picture, specifically the street behind her. And the girl? Well, long story, but there’s no way I can ask her. All I can remember is this location was near a Burberry store. I tried to look it up too, but the streets and buildings were pretty hard to recognize because the pictures on the internet were from 5 years ago. 

As an OSINT legend, I know you can find the street location. So please help me, yeah? Also, sorry for the pixellated image!
