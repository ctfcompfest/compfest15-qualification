## Description 
Look closely, that the envar is hardcoded on the static since it is called at component level. thus, you can get the secret from the static build, do static analysis on the dev tool. 

As for the JWT, it's trivial. since the header is not checked, we can bypass verification by setting the alg=none in the jwt header.
