# Writeup BLooDFUR

This is a Rubik's Cube. Each file represents one side of the Rubik's Cube as a 3x3 matrix (you need to look really meticulously to note that each file is a 3x3 matrix). Participants simply need to create a solver that can rotate each side according to Rubik's Cube notations (R, L, F, B, U, D, R', L', F', B', U', D'). After that, they need to find an algorithm (a sequence of notations) to solve it according to the given cube image, and then run the solver. Once the cube is solved, they should write (combine) each matrix element sequentially into one file, starting from the sides B, L, D, F, U, and then R (as indicated in the challenge title). Participants should pay close attention that there's the "|" symbol as a separator between each equation, so when writing it, they can separate it directly using "\n" to reveal each equation. After that, they should input these equations into Desmos to find the flag.
