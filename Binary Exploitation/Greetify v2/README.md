## Description
Because I'm feeling lonely, I created an application to greet me once again. However, I realized that I'm not the only one who is feeling lonely, so I modified it to be able to greet anyone. Nevertheless, I'm unsure about its safety. Could you please help me check it?

`nc <ip> <port>`
